Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
all of the i think... i used the polling in the about pictures just to meet the requirement, it doesnt add anything and in hindsigt it would 100% make more sense to have used that on the Home page feed ... i will be updating this.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
i havent created categories and i think this project will benifit from that on the Home/feed... if i'm honest i'm alittle bit overwhelmed by the amount i want to achieve with this project so i've focused on getting it to a point where you can see what it will be, i dont have enough time (or current skill level) to make it what i want it to be.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
the hardest part for me was building MyPage. Making images and text draggable, resizable, and then saving that data correctly to the database was much harder than I expected. I created the login first and built my database just for that, then altered it for the MyPage and at first i approacjed it thinking id put it all into the server.js, i'm very glad i create a mypage.js, i also altered the mypage_text in my data base to be mypage_textOld, so i could delete this and then recreate mypage_text with jsonb rather than text, i'm guessing thats not the right way to do it but it worked.
